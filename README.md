# Renewable Dragon Eggs
Simple datapack allowing the dragon to drop an egg on every death

# Overview
Renewable Dragon Eggs is a Minecraft datapack that does one thing; it adds a single loot table entry for the ender dragon to drop an egg on death. 

# Why this datapack?
This ultra lightweight datapack was created for the Genos Community for use on a modded server where dragon eggs are required in certain recipes. While there are several mods that deal with dragon mechanics, and a datapack causing the dragon to drop elytra, there was no quick solution for the matter of the egg. Until now.

Whether for custom crafting, or so everyone can have an egg without resorting to gravity duping, this datapack enables any server to have renewable dragon eggs.

# Known issue: (one) Double drop
Ender dragon mechanics spawn the first egg at 0,0 and are not involved with loot tables. So with this datapack enabled, the first dragon kill will spawn the default egg, as well as one at the dragon's location. If you don't want this to happen, disable the datapack before the first fight and only enable it after the first kill. 
Yes this probably could be handled with predicates and custom advancements, but this datapack isn't meant to be robust. It's a single loot table file, that's it. (If you want to tackle this feel free to open an issue/PR)
